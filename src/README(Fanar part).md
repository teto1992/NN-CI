## What i did
you can find NNEQ and NNET plugins in the directorys in src/lib, also you can find the tests in __tests__/unit/lib
further more in the directory you find a file prova.yml where you have to change the path and then you cn try to execute it follow the IF Documentation, Developers, how to build plugins documentation

## Some comments

further more in the directory you find a file prova.yml where you have to change the path and see if it works also for you, follow the IF Documentation, Developers, how to build plugins documentation
